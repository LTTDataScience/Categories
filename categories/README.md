## Synopsis

Method for exploiting the UMLS Metathesaurus to extract the UMLS concepts which represent signs 
and symptoms anatomically related to each of the organ systems. 

## Database Setup Requirement

In order to run the code for mappings, we need to setup a mySQL database to store the concepts and
relationships in the UMLS. Following are the steps:
1. Download the UMLS and install the Knowledge Sources files
2. Browse the meta folder for the following files: MRCONSO.RRF, MRCUI.RRF, MRREL.RRF, and MRSTY.RRF.
Load these files into mySQL using the provided script file: UMLS_SQL.txt

## Run the program
